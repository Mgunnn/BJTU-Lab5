In late July, a groundbreaking discovery drew public attention. A South Korean team claimed that LK-99 exhibited superconductivity at normal pressure and room temperatures up to 127Â°C, contrasting with conventional superconductors that work at extremely low temperatures and pressures.

However, further investigations have shown that impurities, particularly copper sulfide, were responsible for its apparent characteristics of partial levitation over a magnet and sharp drops in electrical resistivity. Finally, multiple replication attempts dismissed the claim of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99.
